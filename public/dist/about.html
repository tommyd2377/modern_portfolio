        <p>
          Recently completed General Assemblyâ€™s Web Development Immersive course and have 3 years of experience writing software. 
          Knowledgeable with several full-stack web technologies and can pick up new languages and frameworks in a short period of time. 
          I also have a special interest in machine learning and deep neural networks. I am looking to join a mission-driven organization 
          where I can take my skills to the next level. I am knowledgeable with JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Node.js, Express.js, 
          TensorFlow.js, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Git, GitHub, React, Angular, Ionic, Ruby on Rails, SQL, NoSQL, Database Modeling, Postgres, Firebase, and npm.

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>

        <h3>GoPulse</h3>
        <h6>Social News Platform</h6>
        <p>
          GoPulse is my personal attempt to reform the broken news distribution channels we have now. Between the amount of hate on Twitter, 
          the misinformation on Facebook, the polorizing suggestion algorithms on YouTube and the ever present advertsing business model 
          has many people longing for a simple, friendly, and informative platform to get their news from. I propose GoPulse, a subscription 
          based social news aggregator. Try it out and leave me some feedback. tom@gopule.io

        <h3>Hyper_Rank</h3>
        <h6>Collaborative Filtering Algorithm</h6>
        <p>
          Hyper Rank is user-user collaborative filtering algorithm that I have implemented here in Python. It is open source, can be used 
          with any form of content and is designed to be extremeley sensistive with small inputs so it is an excellent choice for apps with a 
          small userbase.
